4. **Consistent Quality**: Optimized image parameters (500x300, crop, q=80)
5. **Performance**: Efficient loading with proper error handling

### Helper Functions:
```javascript
getChannelThumbnail(channelId, category) // Gets appropriate thumbnail
getChannelLogo(channelId)                // Gets channel logo with fallback
```

## Image Sources

## Adding New Images

To add new images for channels:

```

2. **Add logo reference**:
```javascript
LOGO_IMAGES.new_channel = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/...";
```

3. **Update channel definition** in `App.jsx`:
```javascript
{
  id: "new-channel",
  // ... other properties
  logo: getChannelLogo("new_channel"),
  thumbnail: getChannelThumbnail("new_channel", CATEGORIES.SPORTS),
}
```
